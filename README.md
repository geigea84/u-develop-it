1.6
sqlite3 db/election.db < db/schema.sql
The < is called the input redirect. This will override the default standard input, which is the keyboard, and allows the input to come from a file instead. This is not a feature of SQLite but a feature of the shell running in your terminal. It's like loading a bunch of pretyped commands into sqlite3!

2.3
initialize Node.js (create package.json)
npm init --y

Now that we've created package.json, be sure to create the .gitingore file with the node_modules/ entry, as shown in the following line of code, so that we don't needlessly track or push all the npm packages to GitHub:

echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore

The preceding terminal command did two things: it created the .gitignore file, and it wrote node_modules/ to the fileâ€”a nifty trick for a necessary step in every new Node.js application.

npm install express sqlite3

npm install jest --save-dev

Although the tests were provided by a helpful meetup member, we should test them and verify their functionality.

To do this, let's change the current "test" script to the package.json file to the following:

"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
  },
Now let's run the test suite in the terminal and confirm whether the function passes the tests, as follows:

npm test

Add the following to the scripts property in the package.json file below the "test" script we just added:

"migrate": "sqlite3 db/election.db < db/schema.sql",
"seed": "sqlite3 db/election.db < db/seeds.sql",
"db": "sqlite3 db/election.db"

We need to add one more script to start the Express.js server. Add the following to the package.json file under the db script:

"start": "node server.js"

npm run migrate

npm run seed
